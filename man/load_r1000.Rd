\title{Load the Russell 1000 Data (Temporary Storage)}
\usage{
load_r1000()
}
\value{
The function loads the data into the global environment and returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This function downloads and loads the Russell 1000 dataset into the global environment.
The data is temporarily stored in the session's temporary directory (\code{tempdir()}).
}
\details{
The function checks if the \code{r1000.rda} file exists in the temporary directory.
The data is then loaded into the global environment.

This approach ensures that the data is session-specific and does not persist across
R sessions.
