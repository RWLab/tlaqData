\title{Load the Russell 1000 Data (Temporary Storage)}
\usage{
load_r1000_temp()
}
\value{
The function loads the data into the global environment and returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This function downloads and loads the Russell 1000 dataset into the global environment.
The data is temporarily stored in the session's temporary directory (\code{tempdir()}).
If the dataset is already available in the temporary directory, it is loaded directly
without re-downloading.
}
\details{
The function checks if the \code{r1000.rda} file exists in the temporary directory.
If the file does not exist, it downloads the dataset, and saves it in the temporary directory.
The data is then loaded into the global environment.

This approach ensures that the data is session-specific and does not persist across
R sessions.
